# Hands-on ML

This is a project that I have taken from the book *"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow"*. This repository contains the jupyter notebook and python codes that were given in the book.

***Note:*** *I do not intend to use the codes in the book for monetary purposes. It is only for my learning purpose.*
